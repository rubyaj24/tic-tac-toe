*Experiment No.: 2* 	Date:  

### File System Information and User Management  

#### *Aim*  
To implement a menu-driven shell script that retrieves file system details, including disk space usage and mounted file systems, and manages user accounts by creating, deleting, and modifying user details.  

#### *Problem Description*  
- This experiment involves creating a menu-driven shell script to retrieve file system details from the Linux system using commands like df and mount.  
- The script will:  
  - Display total disk space and usage statistics.  
  - List mounted file systems and their details.  
  - Allow user account creation.  
  - Allow user account deletion.  
  - Modify existing user details.  

#### *Algorithm*  
##### *Algorithm 1: File System and User Management*  
1. *Function* FILE_SYSTEM_AND_USER_MANAGEMENT()  
2. While *true* do  
3. Display menu options:  
   - (a) Show disk space usage  
   - (b) Show mounted file systems  
   - (c) Create a new user  
   - (d) Delete an existing user  
   - (e) Modify user details  
   - (f) Exit  
4. Prompt user to enter a choice.  
5. Read user input ‚Üí *choice*  
6. *If choice = a* then  
   - Execute df -h to display disk space usage  
7. *Else if choice = b* then  
   - Execute mount to list mounted file systems  
8. *Else if choice = c* then  
   - Prompt for username  
   - Execute useradd <username>  
   - Set password using passwd <username>  
9. *Else if choice = d* then  
   - Prompt for username  
   - Execute userdel <username>  
10. *Else if choice = e* then  
    - Prompt for username  
    - Execute user modification commands (usermod)  
11. *Else if choice = f* then  
    - Print ‚ÄúExiting‚Ä¶‚Äù  
    - Exit program  
12. *Else*  
    - Print ‚ÄúInvalid choice! Please enter a valid option.‚Äù  
13. *End while*  
14. *End function*
